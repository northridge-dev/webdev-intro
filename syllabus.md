Want to know how the Internet *really* works? Want to build your own (fun |
interesting | useful | beautiful) piece of it?

In **Web Development**, a year-long elective, you'll:

- create interactive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- discover your browser's hidden superpowers
- use databases and APIs
- create a web server

You'll start with drills and exercises that will prepare you for larger, more
complex projects.

## F.A.Q

Q: This sounds like more work than a typical elective.  
A: That's not a question. But your suspicion is correct: this isn't an "easy A"
elective. You *will* have to work, sometimes hard.

Q: Do I need to know how to code already?  
A: No.

Q: What if I already know some HTML or JavaScript or Python or some other
programming language?  
A: Awesome! I promise you have plenty left to learn. Experienced coders will
get the practice and coaching they need to become stronger developers.

## More Buttoned-up Course Description

In this year-long course, you'll learn to code (or code better) by creating web
pages and web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll also learn
how the Internet, the Web, and browsers work at a basic level. Time permitting,
we'll explore databases, APIs (application programming interfaces), and web servers.

## Virtues

Our work is an opportunity to grow in virtue. The more we grow in virtue, the
better we'll be able to do our work.

**Hard work.** Like most things worth doing, learning to code isn't easy. That's
no small part of what makes it enjoyable. You'll sweat a little, but be stronger
for it. Embrace the challenge.

**Craftsmanship.** Anything worth doing is worth doing well. Keep honing your
craft. Do work you can be proud of.

**Adventurousness & daring-do.** Experiment. Tinker. Try new things. Take a
few risks. It's the best way to learn and you (probably) won't blow up
or break anything.

**Perseverance.** Code rarely works the first time. Problems can seem
intractable. Keep at it. You'll figure it out.

**Resourcefulness.** You will (often) hit walls. Better learn how to scale them.
Solutions and help are out there if you learn how to ask and where to look.

**Generosity.** Encourage each other. Help however you can. The more freely you
give, the richer you'll be.

## Goals

### General

0. Grow in virtue (see above).
1. Learn a little about how computers work and how your code *programs* them.
2. Write some non-trivial code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
3. Practice writing better code: more elegant, efficient, robust, etc.
4. Practice reading and assessing code and offering constructive feedback.
5. Build your problem-solving muscles. We'll focus on a few techniques:

   - **decomposing** big problems into smaller, more tractable ones
   - using **abstraction** to manage complexity

6. Improve your ability to communicate technical concepts and decisions to both
   technical and non-technical audiences.

Put another way, by the end of the course, you should be able to:

- write an interesting program,
- understand how it works, what is good or inventive or craftsman-like in it,
  and how it can be improved,
- and explain it and your design to both me and your parents / grandparents /
  friends who weren't brave or wise or lucky enough to take this course.

### Web Development

1. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build dynamic web applications.
2. Understand how the Internet, the Web, and browsers work.
3. Learn how to use common developer tools.

## The Plan

Here's my best guess about how we'll organize ourselves and use our time. We'll
tweak the plan as we go.

### The Work

In class, you'll usually be coding.

- Often, you'll work on shorter exercises or drills meant to help you improve
  your coding range and fluency.
- As you master the building blocks, you'll also work on bigger projects.

We'll often code together: you'll copy the code I'm writing as I explain how
it works. I'll typically ask you to extend or alter what we coded together.

You'll also take one or two quizzes each week to give you and me a better idea
of what you know and what you don't.

Homework will be exceedingly rare. Of course you're welcome to work on projects --
course projects or your own -- at home, if you want.

### Topics and Sequence

Here's a very rough sketch of the topics we'll cover:

1. Basic HTML: how the content of a web page is structured
2. Basic CSS: how to style web pages
3. Basic JavaScript: how to make web pages dynamic and interactive
4. Developer tools, including browser developer tools
5. How the Internet and Web work: client-server model, HTTP, etc.

I'll try to publish a plan for the week before each week's first class.

### Hackathon

We will host at least one hackathon this year. Stay late, eat pizza, build
something cool with friends and show it off.

Highly encouraged, but not required. Dates and details TBD.

## Grades

Your grade will calculated as follows:

- **Effort (50%)**, a daily grade determined by your effort and focus
- **Quizzes (25%)**
- **Projects (25%)**

Quarter and semester grades will be assigned according to the Northridge grading
scale.

## Materials

Please bring to class every day:

1. Something to write with (pen or pencil, as you prefer)
2. A notebook or binder with paper for notes
3. A folder or binder to keep and organize handouts and other materials

## Tools

- [Northridge Dev](https://northridge.dev)

  - daily logs, schedules, notes, resources, exercises and assignments
  - some features require logging in with your Northridge credentials

- [GitHub](https://github.com)

  - used by almost every software developer on Earth to share code and collaborate.
  - it's where I keep course-related code, notes, this syllabus, etc.
  - includes a browser-based IDE (interactive development environment) where we'll
    do some of our coding.
  - owned by Microsoft and free to use
  - requires an email address to create an account

## Responsible Use of Technology

Follow the Computer and Network Technology policy in the student handbook.

If you feel like you need to hide your screen, switch tabs or windows, or
clear your browser history, you're falling short of the mark.

## A Note on Generative AI and Other Code You Didn't Write

We wouldn’t be able to build very interesting projects if we had to write every
line of code ourselves. Indeed, almost all software development depends on code
that developers share with each other, often for free.

It’s fairly easy to find or generate code that can satisfy all or part of your
assignments. We’ll spend time learning how to learn from and responsibly use
such tools. So don't be afraid to tell us where you got an idea, trick, or technique.
I'm most interested in your ability to thoroughly explain your code. If you can't
explain it, it isn't really yours, at least not in the ways that matter most.
